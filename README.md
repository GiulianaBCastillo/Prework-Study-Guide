#  Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created the Prework Study Guide as a response to the need of organization of all the materials that were available during the course. As a developer, it is essential to view the resources whenever you want during the Bootcamp.

Therefore, I built this guide to access to the resources at any time, in a practical, organized and easy to access way. 

By doing this, students will no longer have to create endless notes on their devices and will have everything they need in one place. 


## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics that we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
